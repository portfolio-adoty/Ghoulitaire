# Solitaire.py

A console-controlled prototype made in Python 3 to mock up the logic for the final game. I do this for most of my ideas, especially logic-based mechanics such as world generation, board/card games, or puzzles.

I first mocked up the basic logic before switching over to Godot to start working on the final version and UI.

In this Python prototype you can only move cards between columns, not onto build piles and you can't move stacks of cards. However, I already had a basic idea of the logic for those mechanics and felt like I'd only be wasting time if I were to complete the program when I could start mocking it up in Godot.

# GD Ghoulitaire Directory

The Godot (GD) project directory for the Ghoulitaire project. I have a README in there that goes into more detail about my process right now, but basically I've added UI elements and fleshed out the solitaire logic.

As far as I know the card game itself runs without bugs, but there'll have to be further play testing to confirm that, especially as I continue to add more features and mechanics.
